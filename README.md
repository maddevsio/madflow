# What is Mad Flow?
Mad Flow is an internal project for company's process automation.

## Project purposes
* Systematize and streamline internal company's processes;
* Transfer management processes to Jira and automate them using extensions (add-ons) and Jira functionality;

## Project advantages
Mad Flow helps PMs, HRs and other employees of the Mad Devs admin staff to have up-to-date information on the tasks assigned to them and to close tasks on time. This project will help to solve problems in the early stages and guide PMs to solve these problems.

## Setting up a Workflow

Workflow regulates the movement of tasks in projects.

Workflow can be changed according to the ongoing project’s processes.

To get access to the Workflow's settings, you need to log in as a Jira Administrator and click on Project Settings (in the project’s window in which you're going to change the Workflow).

# Setting up automatic tasks using Issue Templates for Jira

Add-on link: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211044/issue-templates-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview
Official documentation link: https://deviniti.com/support/addon/cloud/issue-templates/latest/getting-started/

We have a need to periodically create tasks with similar content to any project. To avoid manually creating tasks, again and again, we use special add-ons for Jira. Issue Template enables us to create tasks from a template in a few clicks. 
So, to install add-on we need to go to Atlassian Marketplace, Jira Settings > Apps > Find new apps.
